# ab2foo

Just a bunch of random foo we put together for cases when we needed it. Don't judge us -- we're lazy. And this isn't even the half of it, you should see our personal scripts directories!

Anyway, we'll try to put stuff on here that other people might actually find useful in some form or fashion. Furthermore, we figured other people could probably help us improve this stuff as well. So feel free to contribute anything you'd like!

So far, we've got:

    scripts/forcegps.py:
      What? Python script to force GPS EXIF tags on your image files
      Why?  Google Photos hates to put things in the right order that don't have GPS tags
